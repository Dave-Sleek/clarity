# Clarity Tool

**Clarity Tool** is a lightweight, web-based application built with Flask and hosted on **Wikimedia Toolforge**.  
It provides a simple, user-friendly interface to search, view, and explore content from **Wikipedia** and **Wikidata**.

Instead of overwhelming users with long articles, Clarity shows a short summary of the first few paragraphs by default.  
When needed, readers can expand the article to view the full text — ensuring both quick lookups and deeper exploration.
